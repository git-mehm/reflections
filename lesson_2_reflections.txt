What happens when you initialize a repository?
What do you need to do it?
  git init - creates .git in a directory
  git status - shows the status of files in
    the directory
  git reset - clears the staging area
  git add - adds files to staging area

How is the staging area dif from the workg dir?
  these are files that will be committed where
  the workg dir may have files that are not being
  tracked
What value does this offer?
  it allows you to make changes to a file and
  tell git that it will be committed on the next
  commit which may happen after other files are
  finished.
